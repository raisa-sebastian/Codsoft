**Data Science Projects**
During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on a series of hands-on data science projects that involved exploring different datasets, applying machine learning techniques, and delivering actionable insights. Below is a summary of the projects I completed during the internship, highlighting the skills and techniques I developed throughout the experience.

Projects
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective: Built a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, class, and other attributes.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Description: Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. Optimized the model using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve a high prediction accuracy.
2. Movie Rating Prediction
Objective: Developed a recommendation system to predict movie ratings based on historical user ratings and movie features.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise
Description: Built a collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine using matrix factorization. Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and implemented techniques for improving recommendations based on user-item interaction matrices.
3. Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Created a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers based on features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Description: Used the famous Iris dataset to apply machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.
4. Sales Prediction
Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict future sales based on historical sales data, promotional activities, and seasonality.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Description: Performed time series analysis and applied regression techniques, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, to predict sales. Conducted feature engineering to incorporate seasonality and promotional factors. Optimized the model and provided business insights to help improve sales forecasting.
